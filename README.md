Battleship Server
=================

This is a very basic Flask service for playing a completely random game of Battleship. Not intended to be used for any real purpose other than a quick toy API.

As part of a discussion with Chuck Shotton, a company that we were discussing uses this idea as a "pre-interview" test:
write a client that will play battleship against our server and win.

The discussion with Chuck was around if there were better firing patterns in a "hunt-and-sink" strategy than a simple even (or odd) based parity search.

This project was written to easily explore if there were better strategies, as well as having a simple API for playing that could be hosted in Heroku.
